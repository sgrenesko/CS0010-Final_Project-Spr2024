# CS0010-Final_Project-Spr2024
Final project for Pitt CS0010
The parameters for the project utilize three data sets from the city of Pittsburgh to determine which neighborhood will be the best to street race in. This is based on the parameters of traffic light count, police presence via an incident blotter, and speed bump density per neighborhood.
